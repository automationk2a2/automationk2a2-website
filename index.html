<p>I worked with Fortune 500 companies (Yahoo Finance, Mythical Games, Binance, TELUS) but also with 30+ SMBs. With 3+ years of project management and automation managing projects with budgets up to 2+ million in various industries, you’ll have a solid partner to guide you through your automation project.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>After you purchase a subscription, I’ll send you a link to book our first call and to your personal Trello board. You’ll book a call and enter your first requests. We’ll prioritize them in our First Call and during the Prioritization Call moving forward.</p>

<h3>First-time client?</h3>

<p>I recommend getting the Process Map Package before jumping to a subscription. We’ll do a rigorous audit of your processes to understand what is preventing your business from scaling. </p>

<p>Once we identify high-priority processes, we’ll develop systems to streamline your processes and allow your business to scale.</p>
