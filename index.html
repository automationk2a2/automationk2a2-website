<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>After you purchase a subscription, I’ll send you a link to book our first call and to your personal Trello board. You’ll book a call and enter your first requests. We’ll prioritize them in our First Call and during the Prioritization Call moving forward.</p>

<h3>First-time client?</h3>

<p>I recommend getting the Process Map Package before jumping to a subscription. We’ll do a rigorous audit of your processes to understand what is preventing your business from scaling. </p>

<p>Once we identify high-priority processes, we’ll develop systems to streamline your processes and allow your business to scale.</p>

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<p>
  <b>Do I need a Zapier subscription?</b>
  <br>You need to have a Zapier, Make.com, n8n or any other automation services subscription. Please double-check the plans and their different offerings based on your needs. Feel free to ask if you are unsure.
</p>
<p>
  <b>How will we share passwords?</b>
  <br>I recommend you use a password manager like 1Password or LastPass to handle password sharing. Otherwise, you can share your credentials on the Trello board. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>How many requests can I have?</b>
  <br>Add as many requests as you want in the backlog. Each sprint, we’ll choose the 5 requests with the highest priority to work on. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>What if something breaks?</b>
  <br>Share a detailed account of the error with as many details as possible. If this is a high-priority issue, we’ll bump it back at the top of the list in the sprint.
